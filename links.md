* [What is Cyber Security? The Different Types of Cybersecurity](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cyber-security/what-is-cybersecurity/) --- 
Cyber security refers to every aspect of protecting an organization and its employees and assets against cyber threats. As cyberattacks become more common and sophisticated and corporate networks grow more complex, a variety of cyber security solutions are required to mitigate corporate cyber risk.

* [Protection and Security in Operating System | Scaler Topics](https://www.scaler.com/topics/protection-and-security-in-operating-system/) --- 
Operating systems manage both logical and physical resources to prevent interference with each other and unauthorized access from external sources. These methods are categorized as protection and security in the operating system.

* [C Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php) --- 
Website to learn C language. C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.

* [File System in Operating System (OS)](https://www.scaler.com/topics/file-systems-in-os/) --- 
An overview of file system in an operating system to decides the way the contents of its storage medium (secondary memory, etc) are stored and organized.

* [Operating System - File System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm) --- 
Website to learn more about file system in an operating system. This website also contain useful resources to learn more about operating system.

* [FUSE - The Linux Kernel Documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html) --- 
Documentation of FUSE, a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code.

* [C Memory Address](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_memory_address.php) ---
Website to learn about memory addressing. When a variable is created in C, a memory address is assigned to the variable. The memory address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.

* [Memory Management in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/) ---
The term memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data. This website is used by me to learn more about memory management in operating systems.

* [What is Virtual Memory?](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/virtual-memory) ---
This website explains about what virtual memory is, how virtual memory works, types of virtual memory, how to manage virtual memory, and the benefit of using virtual memory.

* [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/) ---
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of the main memory. This website explains about virtual memory in operating systems.

* [5: Concurrency and Process Synchronization - Engineering LibreTexts](https://eng.libretexts.org/Courses/Delta_College/Operating_System%3A_The_Basics/05%3A_Process_Synchronization) ---
This website provides learning materials about the basics of concurrency and process synchronization.

* [Operating System: Threads and Concurrency](https://medium.com/@akhandmishra/operating-system-threads-and-concurrency-aec2036b90f8) ---
If we want a process to be able to execute on multiple CPUs at a time, to take advantage of the multi-core systems, the process must have several execution-context called threads. This medium blog is used to learn more about thread and concurrency.

* [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/) ---
Concurrency is the execution of multiple instruction sequences at the same time. This website is explaining about the basics of concurency in operating system.

* [Process Synchronization in OS - PrepBytes](https://www.prepbytes.com/blog/operating-system/process-synchronization-in-os-definition-working-and-example/) ---
This website is used to learn about process synchronization because is very helpfull when multiple processes are running at the same time and more than one process has access to the same data or resources at the same time.

* [What is Deadlock in Operating System (OS)?](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-deadlocks-introduction) ---
Every process needs some resources to complete its execution. However, the resource is granted in a sequential order. A Deadlock is a situation where each of the computer process waits for a resource which is being assigned to some another process.
